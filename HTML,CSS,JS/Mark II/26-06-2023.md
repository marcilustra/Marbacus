# Token
When the compiler is processing the source code of a C++ program; 
each group of chars separated by a whitespace is called a token.

Tokens are the smallest individual units in a program. 
A C++ prgram is written using the following tokens.

1. Keywords: eg, int, cout, endl
2. Identifiers: int age, char hello[]
3. Constants:
4. Strings
5. Operators: used to perform operation on variables and values
    e.g 100 + 50 the  '+' is the operator

## Types of Operators
1. Arithimetic: 
    Common math ops; 
        add(+), increment(++)
        minus(-), decrement(--)
        divide(/), 
        modulo(%), 
        mutliply(*), exponentiation (**)
2. Assignment: equals plus-equals minus-equals times-equals...
3. Comparison
4. Logical
5. Bitwise 

### ASSIGNMENT:
Based on Arithimetic operators discussed, 
write a program that requests you to input 
your age
and 
the age of your brother

a) The Program should add the two ages together and print the result;
b) Calculate the difference between the ages and print it.
c) Multiply them.
d) Calculate the division remainder of you and your brothers age and print
e) INcrement your age by 1 and decrement your brother's age by one.
All this should be displayed on a single screen. Use approrpiate data types.
